**<h2>contacts.json</h2>**<br>
<h3>Usage</h3><br>
<h4>Adding a New Contact</h4><br>
To add a new contact, you need to insert a new key-value pair into the JSON object, where the key is a unique identifier for the contact, and the value is the RSA public key in PEM format.

Ensure the RSA public key is in PEM format, enclosed with -----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY----- and -----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----.
Add a new entry to the JSON object with a unique identifier as the key and the PEM-formatted public key as the value.

<h4>Retrieving a Public Key</h4><br>
The contacts.json file is utilized by the MorbinographyCLI class in the main.py file, specifically within the prompt_for_recipient method. This method prompts the user to enter a recipient's public key or identifier. If an identifier is provided, the method retrieves the corresponding public key from contacts.json.

<h4>Example Use Case</h4><br>
When a user wants to encrypt a message or an image for a specific recipient, they can provide the recipient's identifier as input. The application then looks up the recipient's public key in contacts.json and uses it for encryption.

<h3>Important Notes</h3><br>
Ensure that each identifier is unique to prevent overwriting existing entries.
The RSA public keys must be in PEM format to be correctly processed by the encryption functions.
Handle this file with care, as it contains sensitive cryptographic material.
